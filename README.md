# Hi, I’m Razvan 👋

I’m a **Computer Science, Statistics, and Mathematics student** at the University of Virginia interested in building systems at the intersection of software, data, finance, and real-world applications. I enjoy working on technically challenging problems that combine theory with hands-on implementation.

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools
- **Languages:** Python, Java, C/C++, SQL  
- **ML & CV:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, YOLOv8  
- **Tools:** Git, Linux, Docker, Arduino, Raspberry Pi  

## 🚀 Interests
- Computer vision and 3D perception  
- Machine learning and real-time inference  
- Quantitative finance and data-driven investing  
- Robotics and embedded systems  

## 📚 What I’m Learning
- **Cloud architectures:** distributed systems, deployment, and scalable ML pipelines  
- **Large Language Models:** training, inference optimization, and applied use cases  
- **Quantitative finance:** options pricing, risk-adjusted returns, and models like Black–Scholes 

## ⚽ Outside of Code
In my free time, I enjoy playing **soccer** and **pickleball**.
